VTS Documentation Website
=========================

A website that documents our Video Translator Service API.

Package
-------

This is part of the Video Translating Service Package (VTS) which consists of the following repositories:

* [VTS API](https://github.com/MissionalDigerati/vts_api)
	* Submodule - [VTS Rendering Engine](https://github.com/MissionalDigerati/vts_rendering_engine)
* [VTS CakePHP Web Interface](https://github.com/MissionalDigerati/vts_web_interface)	
	* Submodule - [VTS CakePHP 2 Plugin](https://github.com/MissionalDigerati/vts_cakephp_plugin)
	
To use this service, you will need one instance of the [VTS API](https://github.com/MissionalDigerati/vts_api) running on a stand alone server, and the [VTS CakePHP Web Interface](https://github.com/MissionalDigerati/vts_web_interface) running on a separate server.
